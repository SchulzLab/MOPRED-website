            In order for medicine to fulfill its promise of personalized
            treatments based on a better understanding of disease biology, it is
            crucial that computer and statistical tools are available to analyze
            the constantly growing amount of patient data. So far, research
            efforts in biomedical data science have primarily focused on
            developing specialized algorithms to analyze specific types of data,
            such as (single-cell) RNA-Seq data, functional MRI data, or data
            from immunohistochemical stains.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-paragraph">
            While some efforts have been made to develop integrative tools for
            related omics data (such as single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq), data
            in modern medicine are often available from a variety of sources,
            including clinical time series data, imaging data, text data, and/or
            pharmacokinetic data in addition to genomic data. A comprehensive
            characterization of patients and model organisms, crucial for the
            advancement of personalized medicine, requires the comprehensive
            integration of these multimodal data from available sources.

            Within this consortium, we define a modality as an experimental
            measurement on a patient/disease model organism. Depending on the
            type of technology, this measurement can take very different digital
            forms (e.g., image, sequencing result, proteomics, etc.). Multimodal
            then refers to a data analysis scenario where at least two data
            modalities need to be integrated. In particular, prediction models
            based on multimodal data have the potential to significantly benefit
            from the synergistic effects of a statistically informed data
            integration strategy, which is the overarching theme of projects in
            this initiative.
